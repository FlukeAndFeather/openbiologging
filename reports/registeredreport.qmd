## Introduction (470/500 words)

Biologging is the practice of using animal-borne sensors to remotely observe animals and their environments [@rutz2009]. In the six decades since a biologist first attached a modified kitchen timer to a seal [@kooyman1966], biologging has become an invaluable, multidisciplinary tool used for ecology [@wilmers2015], atmospheric science [@weinzierl2016; @yonehara2016], and oceanography [@treasure2017]. As biologging data continue to grow in size and complexity (e.g., millions of new records daily in Movebank [@kays2021] and novel sensors like infrasound recorders [@denouden2021]), "big data" methods have been highlighted as a key direction for future developments [@nathan2022; @grÃ©millet2022]. Simultaneously, biologging data are increasingly used to inform conservation efforts across taxonomic groups [@beal2021; @queiroz2019] and regions[@hindell2020]. Yet, for aggregated biologging data to achieve envisioned impacts on research and conservation, increased access is a matter of practical and ethical concern.

Open science practices, such as publishing data and code alongside manuscripts, improve research transparency and efficiency [@lowndes2017; @hampton2017]. However, data "openness" is determined by multiple factors, and poor research data management and sharing practices are a major source of biodiversity data loss [@peterson2018]. Fortunately, the advent of the FAIR principles [@wilkinson2016] ([@tbl-fair]) has provided a useful framework to facilitate open data sharing, with FAIR data enabling groundbreaking advances in synthesis, biodiversity, and conservation science [@halpern2020; @fredston2023; @roche2021; @buxton2021] .

There have been numerous efforts within the biologging research community to promote open data sharing practices. Essential cyberinfrastructure include domain-specific data repositories (Movebank [@kays2021], Seabird Tracking Database [seabirdtracking.org](https://www.seabirdtracking.org), Euromammal [@urbano2021]) and data standards [@sequeira2021; @dettki2023; @kranstauber2011] that facilitate adoption of the FAIR principles ([@tbl-fair]).

: The FAIR principles, as implemented in biologging cyberinfrastructure, support data sharing and improve research transparency and efficiency. {#tbl-fair}

Despite these biologging cyberinfrastructure developments, the general state of open data within the community remains unknown, and there are indications that a majority of tracking data remain inaccessible [@campbell2015; @scarpignato2023]. We will conduct a systematic review of the biologging literature to quantify open data practices, including open data (re)use and sharing by authors of biologging studies published between 2007-2023 (N=4799). The review will quantify the context of biologging studies (e.g., instrumented species and sensor types) and test the following four hypotheses:

**H1:** Open biologging data practices are increasing over time.

**H2:** Overall rates of open biologging data practices remain low.

**H3:** Biologging studies use open data from external sources more than they generate open data.

**H4:** Open biologging data practices vary by taxa, habitat, and spatial vs aspatial (e.g., accelerometer) data.

In addition to hypothesis testing, our review will provide the first biologging bibliometric database, itself a valuable form of cyberinfrastrucure for future systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Based on the results of our review, we will also provide a set of minimum reporting standards (*sensu* MIAPE [@taylor2007] for proteomics experiments and MIReAD [@rund2019] for arthropod abundances) as a resource for authors, journal editors and funding bodies, to facilitate FAIR sharing of biologging data.

## Methods

### Literature review

On such and such a date we searched Web of Science...

### Initial classification

Describe the broad rubric (study type, species instrumented, data availability statement, etc)

### Sampling plan

Stratified sampling across:

-   Time (early 2007-2015, middle 2016-2019, recent 2020-2023)

-   Taxa (mammal, bird, fish, other)

-   Habitat (marine, terrestrial)

-   Spatial vs aspatial

### Open data assessment

Describe the fine-scale rubric (FAIR principle compliance,

### Analysis plan

We'll have multiple binary response variables (F1, F4, A1.1...), which we expect will be correlated (e.g., it's likely $p(F1|F4) > p(F1)$). Generalized estimating equations [@liang1986], as implemented in `geepack` [@halekoh2006], are suitable for this type of data, right?

$$
\begin{bmatrix}F1 \\ F4 \\ A1.1 \\ \vdots \end{bmatrix} \sim t + x + h + s
$$

Where the response variables are compliance with individual FAIR principles, $t$ is years since 2007, $x$ is taxa (mammal, bird, fish, other), $h$ is habitat (marine, terrestrial) and $s$ is sensor type (spatial, aspatial).

Now this brings up an issue with sensor type. What do you do with GPS+accelerometer tags, for instance? GPS may be shared one way and accelerometer another.

#### **H1:** Open biologging data practices are increasing over time

Coefficients for $t$ increase from early to middle to late.

#### **H2:** Overall rates of open biologging data practices remain low

How do we quantify "overall rates"? Examine each response individually? Restrict to late period?

#### **H3:** Biologging studies use open data from external sources more than they generate open data

How do we model this? This is probably wrong but it's a starting point.

$$
o \sim t + x + h + s
$$

Where $o$ is a multinomial variable with four categories: no open data, open external, open biologging, both open.

#### **H4:** Open biologging data practices vary by taxa, habitat, and spatial vs aspatial (e.g., accelerometer) data

$x$, $h$, and $s$ are all significant terms in GEE model. *A priori*, $s_{spatial}$ \> $s_{aspatial}$. But for taxa $x$ and habitat $h$, just predicting there are significant differences.
