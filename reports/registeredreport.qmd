## Introduction (504/500 words)

Biologging is the practice of using animal-borne sensors to remotely observe animals and their environments [@rutz2009]. In the six decades since a biologist first attached a modified kitchen timer to a seal [@kooyman1966], biologging has become an invaluable, multidisciplinary tool used by ecologists [@wilmers2015] and **NOTE**[As I understand Ellis-Soto et al propose but don't demonstrate adoption by climate scientists]{.aside} oceanographers [@treasure2017], and proposed for use in climate science [@ellis-soto2023]. As biologging data continue to grow in size (e.g., millions of new records daily in Movebank [@kays2021]) and complexity (e.g., novel sensors like infrasound recorders [@denouden2021]), "big data" methods have been highlighted as a key direction for future developments [@nathan2022; @grémillet2022]. Simultaneously, biologging data have been proposed as valuable conservation tools across taxonomic groups [@beal2021]; [@queiroz2019]) and regions[@hindell2020]. For aggregated biologging data to achieve envisioned impacts on ecological research and ecosystem conservation, increasing access to these data is a matter of practical and ethical concern. **NOTE**[arguably equitable access might differ from open access, and is not the focus here]{.aside}

Open science practices, such as publishing data and code alongside manuscripts, increase transparency and improve efficiency [@lowndes2017; @hampton2017]. The "openness" of data is determined by multiple factors. The FAIR principles [@wilkinson2016] - findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability - provide a framework for facilitating open data sharing. FAIR data are a critical component of groundbreaking synthesis science [@halpern2020; @fredston2023] and effective conservation practices [@roche2021; @buxton2021]. **NOTE**[I'd like to incorporate Scarpignato et al. 2023 [@scarpignato2023] here. SD: see suggestions below.]{.aside}. Moreover, for fields like ecology and geosciences where a lack of diversity reflects disproportionately hostile treatment of excluded groups [@primack2023; @primack2023; @marín-spiotta2020], FAIR data can serve an important role in transformations towards inclusive research cultures [@ledgerwood2022; @graves2022] (a transformation the open science movement itself is currently undertaking [@srivastava2014; @whitaker2020]). **NOTE**[In the context of movement ecology I often hear a somewhat conflicting argument, i.e., that those already advantaged take less risk and have greater potential for reward through sharing and using open data, e.g. journals with resources to support strict data-sharing policies, organizations with the expertise and computing infrastructure to mine data and build profitable applications, universities with the mission and capacity to run meta-analyses and extract knowledge from their own data and the data of others. In contrast, where data that are findable but not open (less FAIR), those with less access and connections may disproportionately benefit from the direct contact required to discuss and agree on data sharing when data cannot be freely downloaded, which can promote new networking, trust-building, and appropriate participation and credit. Rather than dig into this here, a more direct argument for open data in the context of this study/field might reference Scarpignato et al., the importance of geographic/taxonomic representation in open data, and the ethical argument to ensure data access for future generations (also see my note in \[issue #12\](https://github.com/FlukeAndFeather/openbiologging/issues/12).]{.aside}

There have been numerous efforts within the biologging research community to promote open data sharing practices. Essential cyberinfrastructure include domain-specific data repositories (Movebank [@kays2021], Seabird Tracking Database [seabirdtracking.org](https://www.seabirdtracking.org), Euromammal [@urbano2021]) and data standards [@sequeira2021; @dettki2023; @kranstauber2011] that facilitate adoption of the FAIR principles ([@tbl-fair]).

| Findability      | Data and metadata have a globally unique and persistent identifier (e.g., a digital object identifier, DOI) and are indexed in a searchable resource | Data repositories, like the Movebank Data Repository, improve data discoverability and may assign DOIs to data (avoiding issues with broken hyperlinks, for example)                                                                                                    | A tracking dataset [@newman2023] deposited in the Movebank Data Repository is findable by searching in the repository or by its permanent DOI, 10.5441/001/1.293                                                            |

: The FAIR principles, as implemented in biologging cyberinfrastructure, support data sharing and improve research transparency and efficiency. {#tbl-fair}

Despite these biologging cyberinfrastructure developments, the general state of open data practices within the community remains unknown, and there are indications that a majority of tracking data remain inaccessible [@campbell2015; @scarpignato2023]. **NOTE**[Would love a more recent citation here. SD: see suggestion\...]{.aside}. We will conduct a systematic review of the biologging literature to establish a baseline of open data practices. The review will quantify the context of biologging studies (e.g., instrumented species and sensor types) and their data sharing practices. By data sharing practices, we refer to how biologging studies both share data (e.g., were the data assigned a persistent identifier such as a DOI?) and utilize other sources of open data (e.g., satellite remote sensing data). Our review will test the following four hypotheses:

**H1:** Open biologging data practices are increasing over time.

**H2:** Overall rates of open biologging data practices remain low.

**H3:** Open biologging data practices vary by taxa, habitat, and spatial vs aspatial (e.g., accelerometer) data.

**H4:** Biologging studies rely on open data from external sources more than they provide open data.

In addition to hypothesis testing, our review will provide the first biologging bibliometric database, itself a valuable form of cyberinfrastrucure for future systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Based on the results of our review, we will also provide a set of minimum reporting standards (*sensu* MIAPE [@taylor2007] for proteomics experiments and MIReAD [@rund2019] for arthropod abundances) that journal editors and funding bodies can implement to assess compliance of biologging data with journal and grant open science policies.
