## Introduction (500/500 words)

Biologging is the practice of using animal-borne sensors to remotely observe animals and their environments [@rutz2009]. In the six decades since a biologist first attached a modified kitchen timer to a seal [@kooyman1966], biologging has become an invaluable, multidisciplinary tool used for ecology [@wilmers2015], atmospheric science [@weinzierl2016; @yonehara2016], and oceanography [@treasure2017]. As biologging data continue to grow in size (e.g., millions of new records daily in Movebank [@kays2021]) and complexity (e.g., novel sensors like infrasound recorders [@denouden2021]), "big data" methods have been highlighted as a key direction for future developments [@nathan2022; @gr√©millet2022]. Simultaneously, biologging data have been proposed as valuable conservation tools across taxonomic groups [@beal2021; @queiroz2019] and regions[@hindell2020]. For aggregated biologging data to achieve envisioned impacts on ecological research and ecosystem conservation, increasing access to these data is a matter of practical and ethical concern.

Open science practices, such as publishing data and code alongside manuscripts, increase transparency and improve efficiency [@lowndes2017; @hampton2017]. The "openness" of data is determined by multiple factors. The FAIR principles [@wilkinson2016] ([@tbl-fair]) provide a framework for facilitating open data sharing. FAIR data are a critical component of groundbreaking synthesis science [@halpern2020; @fredston2023] and effective conservation practices [@roche2021; @buxton2021]. Furthermore, primary biodiversity data, including those recorded by biologgers, will be important for future generations to understand the history and trajectory of their ecosystems. Inconsistent data curation practices are a major source of biodiversity data loss [@peterson2018], which the FAIR principles can help address.

There have been numerous efforts within the biologging research community to promote open data sharing practices. Essential cyberinfrastructure include domain-specific data repositories (Movebank [@kays2021], Seabird Tracking Database [seabirdtracking.org](https://www.seabirdtracking.org), Euromammal [@urbano2021]) and data standards [@sequeira2021; @dettki2023; @kranstauber2011] that facilitate adoption of the FAIR principles ([@tbl-fair]).

: The FAIR principles, as implemented in biologging cyberinfrastructure, support data sharing and improve research transparency and efficiency. {#tbl-fair}

Despite these biologging cyberinfrastructure developments, the general state of open data practices within the community remains unknown, and there are indications that a majority of tracking data remain inaccessible [@campbell2015; @scarpignato2023]. We will conduct a systematic review of the biologging literature to establish a baseline of open data practices. The review will quantify the context of biologging studies (e.g., instrumented species and sensor types) and their data sharing practices. By data sharing practices, we refer to how biologging studies both share data (e.g., were the data assigned a persistent identifier such as a DOI?) and utilize other sources of open data (e.g., satellite remote sensing data). Our review will test the following four hypotheses:

**H1:** Open biologging data practices are increasing over time.

**H2:** Overall rates of open biologging data practices remain low.

**H3:** Open biologging data practices vary by taxa, habitat, and spatial vs aspatial (e.g., accelerometer) data.

**H4:** Biologging studies rely on open data from external sources more than they provide open data.

In addition to hypothesis testing, our review will provide the first biologging bibliometric database, itself a valuable form of cyberinfrastrucure for future systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Based on the results of our review, we will also provide a set of minimum reporting standards (*sensu* MIAPE [@taylor2007] for proteomics experiments and MIReAD [@rund2019] for arthropod abundances) that journal editors and funding bodies can implement to assess compliance of biologging data with journal and grant open science policies.
